# Coding3_Machinelearning

Hi! This is my final project for Coding3 Machine Learning Unit. It is a style transfer exploration example which contains three notebooks. The frist notebook is trying to understand how to do style transfer by using two ways: tensorflow Hub and VGG19. The second notebook is trying to further development and try different optimizing way. The third notebook is my exploration based on final 1 and final 2 notebook.

## Findings:
From the exploration in the first notebook and second notebook, I found that the greater the difference in style between the content image and the style image, the more pronounced the effect of style transfer.

## Reference
The reference code are:
