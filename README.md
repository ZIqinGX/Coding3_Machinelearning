# Coding3_Machinelearning

Hi! This is my final project for Coding3 Machine Learning Unit. It is a style transfer exploration example which contains three notebooks. The frist notebook is trying to understand how to do style transfer by using two ways: tensorflow Hub and VGG19. The second notebook is trying to further development and try different optimizing way. The third notebook is my exploration based on final 1 and final 2 notebook. In this practice, I mainly tried to figure out how the style of content picture will influence the outcome? 

## Findings:
1.From the exploration in the first notebook and second notebook, I found that the greater the difference in style between the content image and the style image, the more pronounced the effect of style transfer.

2.From the third practice in code, I found that the Tensorflow hub model can generate images mainly based on the style. The style image can influence outcome of style transferred picture heavily. By adjusting the weight of content and style picture, the value or influence of them on mixed result will change. So I can adjust pictures by change their weight.
